  <li> Spend time with your family playing games, or talking to each other, instead of staying online. </li>
  <li> Video call your friends or relatives who live very far away. </li>

</ol>

<h1> DONT'S </h1>
<ol>
  <li class="list"> Do not, and do not burst crackers. These have harmful toxins that will make you <br> ill, directly
  or indirectly. </li>
  <li> Do not go to any grand party for diwali, as there is a lot of food wasted. </li>
  <li> Do not cut trees indirectly. Instead plant a tree. </li>
  <li> Do not launch flying lanterns in the sky, as it can disrupt an airplane, or hit a bird. </li>
</ol>

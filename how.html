environment, but still enjoy Diwali. There are many ways to do that. Find the steps below: </p>

<ul>
  <li> You can make crackers from waste paper. The best thing about them is that they don't pollute the environment as
  there is no need to burn them. </li>
  <li> You can talk to your relatives, have a video chat with them if you can't meet them. </li>
  <li> You can call your friends home, and have a party. </li>
  <li> You can also donate your old clothes, books, toys, etc. that you do not use to a organisation for the needy,
  or just give it to them on this auspicious day. </li>
  <li> You can distribute sweets to your neighbours, friends, and your relatives. </li>
